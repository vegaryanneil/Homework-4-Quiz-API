# Homework-4-Quiz-API

I reviewed many other projects similar to this project and broke it down to a point where I could understand what each line of code was doing. I was still unable to get some portions of the project to work how I envisioned it.

The projects/resources I looked at are:

I started off the project writing out what I wanted to happen. Then tried to replicate those actions on javascript.

For the quiz questions, I used w3 schools javascript quiz and copied the questions and choices from there.

I was pretty quick with CSS. I mainly just tried to put everything in a box and center it.

The reason I split up all the html, css, js files is because I felt like I was scrolling through too much code and it became increasingly difficult to pick up where I last left off the next day. It was a little tricky getting all the pages to navigate properly, but after a lot of testing, I was able to ensure all the buttons lead to the right place.
