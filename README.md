# Homework-4-Quiz-API

The following project is a quiz with 5 questions. Each question is worth 10 points and the final score will be recorded at the end. If your score is equal to or greater than the top five scores, your name will be added to the list. If it is less than the top 5, your name will not be added to the list. You will know you got the correct answer when your answer has a green background applied and your score goes up by 10 points. If you get an incorrect answer the background will have a red color applied. The quiz has a 1 second delay of transition to each question to prevent users from rapid clicking through.

The design of the quiz is inspired by Coding Nepal and James Q Quick.

I reviewed many other projects similar to this project and broke it down to a point where I could understand what each line of code was doing. I was still unable to get some portions of the project to work how I envisioned it.

The projects/resources I looked at are:

I started off the project writing out what I wanted to happen. Then tried to replicate those actions on javascript.

For the quiz questions, I used w3 schools javascript quiz and copied the questions and choices from there.

The reason I split up all the html, css, js files is because I felt like I was scrolling through too much code and it became increasingly difficult to pick up where I last left off the next day. It was a little tricky getting all the pages to navigate properly, but after a lot of testing, I was able to ensure all the buttons lead to the right place.
